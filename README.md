## Unit 4 Project: OOP Game Show App

**Summary:** This project uses JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming to create a phrase hunter game.  It allows players to guess letters of a random phrase by either selecting a key from on the screen or by pressing a key on their keyboard.  

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
